# 🐭PikaPHP🐘
⚡️The Small, Swift, and Powerful Toolkit⚡️

## 🐭PikaPHP🐘 - What's in a Name?

Why is the project called 🐭PikaPHP🐘? The name is inspired by the adorable pika, a small mammal that resembles a tiny mouse, and the mighty elephant associated with PHP.

Just as a pika is small but resilient and resourceful, PikaPHP offers simple, efficient tools to help developers tackle the large-scale tasks of PHP development. My goal is to provide lightweight solutions that make your PHP projects feel easier, smaller, and more manageable!

# 🐭PikaPHP🐘
🐭⚡️The Small, Swift, and Powerful REST API framework⚡️🐘

## 🐭PikaPHP🐘 - What's in a Name?

Why is the project called 🐭PikaPHP🐘? The name is inspired by the adorable pika, a small mammal that resembles a tiny mouse, and the mighty elephant associated with PHP.

Just as a pika is small but resilient and resourceful, PikaPHP offers simple, efficient tools to help developers tackle the large-scale tasks of PHP REST API development. The goal is to provide a lightweight API framework that makes your PHP projects feel easier, faster, and more manageable!
